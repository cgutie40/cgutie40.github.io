The code below was used for a software verification assignment on a breadboard prototype, not the final design. The breadboard used two potentiometers to simulate the SHT31-ARP-B sensor outputs: one for relative humidity and one for temperature. If either simulated signal exceeded its threshold voltage, the system drove a GPIO output low to notify the main subsystem to trigger the alarm.
