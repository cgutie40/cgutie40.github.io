## Overview

**Schematic Overview — Humidity & Temperature Subsystem**

The schematic depicts the complete electrical design of the Humidity & Temperature Subsystem, showing how power, sensing, buffering, and digital communication are integrated.

A linear voltage regulator (LM7805T) provides a stable 5 V supply to all components within the subsystem, including the SHT31-ARP-B sensor, MCP6004 operational amplifier, Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, red LED, and debug pushbutton circuit.

*Sensor & Signal Buffering*

The SHT31-ARP-B sensor outputs two analog signals:

- Relative Humidity (RH) signal

- Temperature (T) signal

Each signal is routed through one of the MCP6004’s op-amp channels, configured as unity-gain voltage followers (buffers).
These buffers provide signal isolation and stability, ensuring the sensor outputs are not affected by the input impedance of the microcontroller’s ADC. No amplification or filtering is applied — the goal is to preserve the original sensor voltage while allowing accurate ADC readings.

*Microcontroller Interface*

Buffered signals are fed into the PIC18F57Q43 via its analog input pins:

- RA0 (ADC1) → Temperature signal input

- RA1 (ADC1) → Humidity signal input

The microcontroller continuously monitors these readings.
If the humidity exceeds a preset threshold (indicating a potential water leak), the firmware outputs a digital HIGH signal from RD5/RD7, routed to pin 3 of the team connector, which communicates with the alarm subsystem to activate the speaker.

*Indicators & Debug Features*

- A red LED, driven by PWM pin RF4, serves as a visual alert or status indicator.

- A pushbutton debug circuit provides manual input testing for system verification.

*Power Distribution*

All components operate from the regulated 5 V rail supplied by the LM7805T.
Decoupling capacitors are included near key ICs to reduce noise and allow stable analog readings.
